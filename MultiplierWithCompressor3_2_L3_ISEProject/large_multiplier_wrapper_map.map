    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  16,720    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      8
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         8

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,279 out of  11,640   10%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,828
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         3,275 out of   3,828   85%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 164 out of   3,828    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         389 out of   3,828   10%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               7 out of  93,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
